# Weather Forecast Application

Weather Forecast application built with Dart/Flutter. For this project, I used GetX and Flutter_Bloc as state management. And for data sources, I'm using API from OpenWeatherMap API. Thanks to [Reynaldi Daniel](https://www.figma.com/@heyrey) for his UI Design as inspiration for the front end of this application, I'll attach the link for his UI design right below this description.
